# Meteor-Shower-Prediction
This project takes the name of a city and returns the date and type of meteor shower experienced in that city.

<h2>Working of the project</h2>
<ul>
 <li>In this project we have a dataframe containing information about the constellation visible from different cities. The location of the cities is given in terms of longitude and lattitude.</li>
 <li>We also have a dataframe containing the information about the meteor shower and the constellation they are spotted in.</li>
 <li>In the next dataframe we have information about the timing of the meteor shower. Their start month and their end month.
  <li>We use the pandas module and the numpy module to extract the relevant information from the various dataframes and write a function that predicts the time and name of the meteor shower.
</ul>

<h3>Info about the function</h3>
<p>The prediction function takes a name of a city as input and returns the name of all the meteor showers and the start month and the end month the meteor showers that are experienced in that city</p>
